# Weather-JSON-Example
Example Project using the Open Weather Map API in Objective-C.

This project will contact the Open Weather Map API and return the requested query (city) in the form of a JSON object. The received data from the request will be displayed on the app. 

This serves merely as a tutorial/example project to assist developers who wants to learn:
* How to contact an API service.
  * How to request data from any URL in that matter. 
* How to parse/serialize the returned JSON object structure into an object.
  * This is similar to creating Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs) in Java using Jackson from JSON files. 
* Pass and show the results of the JSON file, which has been received through a URL session, on the view.
